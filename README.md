Notebook Name -> 1. Adolescent Fertility Rate_Upload - In this problem set we will guide you through different ways of accessing real data sets and how to summarize and describe it properly. First we will go through some of the data that is collected by the World Bank. We will do some cleaning on the data before we start analyzing it. Then, we will try to do a simple web scraping exercise where we will analyze the data as well.
Let’s start with this dataset from the World Bank. Please download and save this file in a folder where you can get it easily.
This dataset is from the World Bank Gender Statistics website. You may visit the website and explore other datasets they offer. However, for the purposes of this assignment, please use the file in this set of instructions, since the dataset on the World Bank website may have been updated in the time since this problem set and answer key was posted.
For the purpose of analyzing the data, we are going to use Python. WE are going to see there are multiple indicators of gender, countries and years in the data.
In this case we are just interested in analyzing the data for one indicator that is the Adolescent Fertility Rate, in the data the indicator code for this variable is called SP.ADO.TFRT .
This indicator measures the annual number of births to women 15 to 19 years of age per 1,000 women in that age group. It represents the risk of childbearing among adolescent women 15 to 19 years of age. It is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19. Once we complete this assignment set we’ll have more information of how this rate has evolved over time and how it varies across different groups of countries.
